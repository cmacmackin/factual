FACTUAL: Field Abstract Calculus Type Usable and Aesthetic Library
==================================================================
This library provides abstract types to represent mathematical fields
in Fortran. These are both scalar and vector fields. It also contains
(at present) one concrete implementation of these types, using a
pseudo-spectral approach and tracking field values at Chebyshev 
collocation points.
